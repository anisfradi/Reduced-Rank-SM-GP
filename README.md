## Project Description

This demo showcases the "Reduced-rank SM-GP" method, which is a powerful technique for probabilistic time-frequency representations. The method combines reduced-rank approximation with spectral mixture Gaussian processes to capture the time-frequency structure of signals or data.

## Installation

To run this MATLAB demo, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the `demo.m` file to execute the demo code.
4. Follow the instructions in the demo to explore and analyze the results.

Make sure you have MATLAB installed and any required dependencies are properly set up.

## Usage

The demo provides a user-friendly interface for demonstrating the "Reduced Rank Spectral Mixtures Gaussian Processes" method. It allows users to load their own data or use preloaded example datasets. The demo code provides clear instructions and explanations of the method's functionalities. Users can modify the parameters and settings to experiment with different scenarios.
Alternatively, the `demo.temporal_learning` is an option with learning in the temporal domain.
